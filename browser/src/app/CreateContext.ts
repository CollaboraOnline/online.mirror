/*
	Creating an object by dragging out its box, as the office does: an object chosen to be added
	is not put in the middle of the slide, it puts one into this mode. A press sets one corner of
	the box and the drag sets its size; letting go asks the engine for the object in that
	rectangle, and the mode is over. Escape, a command or a press anywhere else end the mode
	without an object; what a click without a drag does is the kind's own.

	Before the press lines across the view mark where the drag would begin, snapped as the drag
	snaps, with its place beside them; during the drag the frame of the object is drawn with its
	size beside it. As in the office, Shift makes the box as wide as high, Alt drags it from its
	middle, and Ctrl turns the snap over.

	This is what every kind made by a box shares; a kind of object says the rest in a class of its
	own.
