	Draws two hairline rectangles per object of the part a view shows, each in the object's own
	color: the upright box the object paints into, and the unit rectangle put through the object's
	transformation, which shows the rotation and the shear. It is a way to see the geometry the
	client holds for each object, which is what a hit test and a client-side move work from.

	The rectangles come from the vector rendering cache, so nothing is asked of the engine for them
	and an object with no primitives of its own, such as a group, still shows its box. It draws
	after the section that paints the page and before the overlay, so the cursors, selections and
	handles the overlay draws stay on top.

	The same cache answers what lies under a point. The mouse pointer is worked out from that rather
	than asked of the engine, and the object under the pointer is outlined along the geometry that
	answered. The section is there whenever the document is drawn from vector primitives, so both
	always are. The rectangles per object and the name of what was hit are drawn only while the
	debug panel's "Vector Overlays" tool is on.
