	One thing a person does to a selection between taking hold of it and letting go: scaling it
	by a handle, turning it, moving it, moving a point of a path. It begins when it is made,
	follows the mouse while it moves, and either finishes, which tells the engine what it did,
	or is called off, which tells it nothing.

	While it runs it says two things about itself: the transformation it stands for, which draws
	the objects as they would look, and where the handles stand, which draws them along with it.
	Both are worked out in the client, so nothing is asked of the engine until the end.
